This repository contains [dream2nix](https://dream2nix.dev) modules to build the
[500 most popular pypi packages](https://github.com/hugovk/top-pypi-packages)
at the time of writing (July 2024). It's mostly an example for demonstration
and testing purposes.

There is a [HTML report](https://nix-community.github.io/dream2nix-pypi-most-popular/) available,
offering a quick overview on [buildbot.nix-community.org](https://buildbot.nix-community.org) CI results.
